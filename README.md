Learning Python automation from  [Hacking Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/HackingSimplifiedAS) video.
This script is also result of the [video](https://youtu.be/Wf8wIzFzbFU) from the Python automation series.
I learn along and try to create the Web Scanner by following the steps from the series as progressed.
